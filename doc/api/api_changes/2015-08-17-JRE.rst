 Preserve units with Text position
 `````````````````````````````````

Previously the 'get_position' method on Text would strip away unit information
even though the units were still present.  There was no inherent need to do
this, so it has been changed so that unit data (if present) will be preserved.
Essentially a call to 'get_position' will return the exact value from a call to
'set_position'.

If you wish to get the old behaviour, then you can use the new method called
'get_unitless_position'.
